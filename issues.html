          <h4>Parks and Recreation</h4>
          <p>
            We talk a lot about parks and recreation.  We have developed a Master Park Plan
            with citizen input to determine our current and future needs.  During this
            process, it became apparent that some people feel we have enough parks and
            others disagree.  The creation of the Master Park Plan balanced these concerns
            and set a course to determine where we need more parks and what those parks
            should include.  I recognize that we need more parks for baseball, soccer, and
            football fields.  I believe that youth sports provide a tremendous opportunity
            for our city’s youth to learn valuable life lessons and develop healthy habits.
            I also, however, recognize that we need places for our citizens to go to relax,
            meditate, and enjoy the outdoors without the commotion often associated with
            sports fields.  I will work to listen to citizen input on these issues and
            create parks and recreation opportunities that address these diverse interests.
            To this end, and in accordance with our plan, the City has purchased property
            for new parks this year and will continue to purchase more property, as is
            prudent, to keep up with future needs.

          <h4>Water</h4>
          <p>
            Lehi has sufficient and secure access to culinary water to satisfy
            our needs.  During the past couple of years, Lehi has implemented
            measures to ensure that citizens have an adequate supply of
            irrigation water.  Lehi has often been the first city to implement
            such measures—though surrounding communities always follow.  These
            restrictions were implemented early *** The City has recently drilled
            more wells and built additional holding ponds to provide us with
            additional irrigation water.  One of these holding ponds is designed
            to catch water that overspills from other holding ponds.

          <h4>Growth</h4>
          <p>
            The City continues to grow—both in the number of residents and
            businesses.  With growth, comes related concerns:  traffic, emergency
            services, infrastructure needs, etc.  Lehi is an attractive place to
            live and work—so future growth is inevitable.  We are only one-third
            build out at the present time.  The City continues to study the most
            effective ways to manage growth and continue to provide top-notch
            emergency service, parks and recreation, and other services.  With
            this information, and your input, I believe future growth can be
            efficiently managed and ultimately enrich our great community.
