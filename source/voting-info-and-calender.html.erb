      <h3>Voting</h3>
      <p>
      The vote by mail system implemented for the 2015 primary elections
      increased voter participation dramatically.  Voting in the general
      election will also be using the vote by mail system.  Make sure you
      send in your ballot and do not throw it away or miss your voting
      deadline.  I would love the opportunity to serve the citizens of Lehi
      for another term and would appreciate your vote.  Even if you choose
      not to vote for me, I hope you will still exercise your right to vote.
